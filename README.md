# microglia_MACH
Using the MACH filter to detect microglia morphology in brain tissue

The code is still in development, to run the code:
1) Assign parameters in the "Params.yaml" file
2) Open the "hierarchical_filtering.ipynb" to run the filtering.


Instructions to add:
- logging into faust/accessing the data set
- regenerating binary images from command-line execution of this code
- basic I/O and 'centroid detection' for cells
