#Parameters used for testing the filtering protocol

InputImage: "./TestImages/newSample.png" #the input image
TrueImage: "./TestImages/Sample_annotate.png" #the annotated truth image, for validation only. Set as "None" if it is normal run


#FilterInfo:
FilterDir: "./filter_images"
FilterNames:
  NormalFilters: ['ram','rod','hyp','amoe','dys']  # normal MACH filter constructed from cropped cells
  PenaltyFilters: ['rodp','rrodp','ramoep'] 
    # "rodp" : penalty filter for rod filter constructed from rampfiled filter by masking out the rod part
    # "rrodp" : penalty filter for rod filter by reversing the rod filter [np.max(rod) - rod]
    # "ramoep": similar to rrodp, reversing the amoe filter

  PartialFilters: ['ramp','hypp'] 
    # "ramp" : process only filter of ramified filter
    # "hypp" : process only filter of hypertrophic filter
  

#TODO: To apply the protocol to real image, we may need to add standard preprocessing
# function to remove the bluedots
#PreprocessImage:
#  RemoveBlueDots: True  #

#TODO: implement the FilterOrder 2
FilterOrder: 1
# 1: pick up rod --> pick up ramified/hypertrophic --> pick up amoeboid/dystrophic
# 2: pick up ramified/hypertrophic --> pick up rod --> pick up amoebioid/dystrophic
